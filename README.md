Ubuntu-based Vagrant for Ruby & Node Development, With Docker and Heroku Tools
=========================

This is a real Vagrant VM setup that I use for some personal development work that you are free to clone, fork, copy, etc.

This will work given a standard [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) installation on OSX (and probably Windows too, although I haven't tried that), and a standard [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) installation. 

I would also suggest the following Vagrant plugin to keep your Virtualbox Guest Additions version up to date on the Vagrant VM.

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```
